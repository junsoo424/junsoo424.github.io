I am a Ph.D. student in the Optimization & Machine Learning(OptiML) Laboratory at [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST AI)](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr), where I'm fortuned to be advised by [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io/). 

Before this, I got my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science and Electrical Engineering (double major) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

* [08/2024] Our paper on Cutout and CutMix was selected as **KT Best Paper Award** at the 2024 <a href="http://aiassociation.kr" target="_blank">Korean AI Association</a> Conference (CKAIA 2023)!

* [06/2024] One paper got accepted to ICML 2024 Workshop on [Advancing Neural Network Training (WANT): Computational Efficiency, Scalability, and Resource Optimization](https://want-ai-hpc.github.io/icml2024/about/). Our paper proposes a theory-inspired method called *Direction-Aware SHrinking (DASH)*, which aims to mitigate plasticity loss.

* [06/2024] Our theoretical work on Cutout and CutMix got accepted to ICML 2024 Workshop on [High-dimensional Learning Dynamics 2024: The Emergence of Structure and Reasoning](https://sites.google.com/view/hidimlearning/home).

* [12/2023] I defended my Master's degree and I will start my Ph.D.

* [06/2023] [Our paper on theoretical analysis of Mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00267) is out! I'm very happy to hear that this work got accepted to ICML 2023.

* [02/2022] I received my bachelor's degree and will start the master's course at KAIST AI.
