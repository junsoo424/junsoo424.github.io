I am a Ph.D. student in the Optimization & Machine Learning(OptiML) Laboratory at [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST AI)](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr), where I'm fortuned to be advised by [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io/). 

Before this, I got my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science and Electrical Engineering (double major) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
